## Avalible distros
- [x] ubuntu 20.10 groovy (groovy)
- [x] ubuntu 20.04 focal (focal)
- [x] ubuntu 18.04 bionic (bionic)
- [x] kali nethunter-rootless (nethunter)
- [x] alpine (alpine)
- [x] arch Linux (archlinux)

> - Old builds like Ubuntu bionic are recomended to install cause Android blocks important syscalls in newer builds like (ubuntu(groovy,focal) , kali nethunter) which lead to problems like kde-desktop crash and etc. Be sure to notice me in issues if you find any problems except `init` dependent in newer builds.

## Tested & supported desktop environment
- [x] xfce4
- [x] mate
- [x] lxde
- [x] lxqt
